This project creates 360-degree videos that transition between two 360-degree images.
The transition optionally passes through a liminal space generated by AI.
The project demo video is available at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4CyvdE3Y3g.

Examples of transitions generated with this repo that you can view on a VR headset:

This repo provides a browser-based interface for generating transitions between two arbitrary environments captured in 360-degree images.
It uses Stable Diffusion XL 1.0.

If you want to use the ComfyUI workflows in your own instance of ComfyUI, this repo contains the workflow.json files that created the API versions called in the Python files.

## Dependencies

- ComfyUI (standalone installation version)
- Python (I am using 3.11, but should work with any Python 3)
