# In a liminal office space where two realities converge, the floor is a mosaic of sandy yellow paths and light grey office tiles, forming a checkerboard that bridges the desert with the corporate. The ceiling overhead is a spectacle of transformation: one half retains the open expanse of a clear blue sky, while the other half arches in segments of office-like light brown, dotted with both fluorescent lights and the whimsical floating rings of an aerial game.

# Desks and computers, with their orderly array of office paraphernalia, share this space with playful geometric shapes that belong to an outdoor game, including cones and cubes resting on work surfaces and floors. Traffic cones stand in place of some office chairs, and the obstacle course rings hang in the air, occasionally looping through the arms of desk lamps.

# A doorway frames a snippet of the outdoor game track, seemingly leading into the vastness of a playful landscape, while another opens to the structured confines of a corridor with yellow walls. The distant view blends low-poly trees and mountain silhouettes into the neutral tones of office partitions.

# Notice boards, half-covered in blue, peek from walls that are merging the horizon of the game world with the pragmatic surfaces of an office. Lighting is a dance of sunlight and the artificial glow of an indoor work environment, casting an array of shadows that belong to neither world completely. This space is a canvas of transition, a visual narrative of two disparate environments slowly merging into a single, surreal tableau.
